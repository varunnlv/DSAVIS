              <p>
                Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by computer scientist Edsger
                Dijkstra in 1956, is a graph search algorithm that solves the
                single-source shortest path problem for a graph with
                non-negative edge weights, producing a shortest path tree.

                A* is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding
                and graph traversal. It is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm
                with heuristic methods to improve performance and find the
                shortest path between nodes efficiently.

                Breadth First Search is an algorithm used for traversing or
                searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree
                root (or some arbitrary node of a graph), and explores all of
                the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to
                the nodes at the next depth level.

                Depth First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching
                tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root
                node and explores as far as possible along each branch before
                backtracking.

                A random maze is a maze generated randomly, often used for
                testing pathfinding algorithms. It consists of walls and open
                passages arranged in a randomized pattern.

              <p>
                Recursive division maze generation is a method of generating
                mazes by recursively dividing a region into smaller sections and
                creating walls between them. It often results in maze structures
                with interesting patterns.

              <p>
                A weighted maze is a maze where each cell has a weight
                associated with it. These weights can represent the cost of
                moving through the cell and are used in pathfinding algorithms
                to find the most efficient path.
